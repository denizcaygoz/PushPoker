## Rules 
*The object of the game is to have the best hand score among the other players. 
The combination of each player's 3 open and 2 hidden cards determines the value of each player's hand.
*The game is player between 2-4 players.
*The number of rounds can be set from 2 to 7.
*Each player has 2 hidden and 3 open cards, but unlike hidden cards, open cards can be seen by other players.
*There is 1 draw stack, 1 discard stack, and 3 cards in the middle.
*When it is the player's turn to move, the player must first perform the "Push Left" or "Push Right" action.
*After the push action is performed, the player may perform one of the following actions: swap one, swap all, end turn. 
After performing any of these actions, the player ends his turn.
*To swap one, player must select one of his cards and one of the cards on the middle to swap.
*To swap all, player click "Swap All" button and swaps all of his 3 oppen cards with 3 cards on the middle.

the game ends and players are ranked according to their Hand Value Score
*The hand value score is calculated using standard poker rules.
